# PIY - Patch it Yourself
To apply the freebird patches yourself you just have to follow 3 simple steps!

## 1. Getting the app
Get a decrypted ipa of the latest Version by either decrypting it yourself from a jailbroken iPhone or using services like [Decrypted App Store](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us) (Requires a free account) or [Decrypt.day](https://decrypt.day) (warning: Decrypt.day might not always have the latest Twitter version available, for the absolute latest directly fetched from the app store use the Decrypted App Store instead.)

## 2. Modifying the app
Now comes the fun part! Clone this repo by running this in your Terminal: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/actuallyaridan/NeoFreeBird.git
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also [download it as a .zip file](https://github.com/actuallyaridan/NeoFreeBird/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) if you'd like to avoid the Terminal.

Next, decide if you'd like the older icons or the newer ones. Pick the folder containgning the icons you prefer. You can see a comparison of the new and old icons below if you're unsure which to pick:
