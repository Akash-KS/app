## Prerequisites 
- An IPA of NeoFreeBird

## Step 0
Connect your iPhone to your Mac or PC, You might have to trust the computer on your iPhone.

## Step 1
Drag the IPA into Sideloadly, press “Start”, make sure “Apple ID Sideload” is selected and authenticate with your Apple ID if asked to do so. Your credentials are sent directly to Apple to sign the app, Sideloadly does not touch them.

## Step 2
Try opening NeoFreeBird from your home screen - if this is your first time sideloading with this Apple ID you might be prompted to trust the app under `General > VPN & Device Management > yourappleid@example.com`. Additionally you might be prompted to enable Developer Mode by going to `Privacy & Security > Developer Mode`.
