# FreeBird
FreeBird is an custom IPA of twitter that aims to remove as much X branding and text as possible as well as remove unnecessary features.

This is done by replacing files in the offical X ipa with ones from pre-X builds of twitter. all of the text had to be changed to remove all the changes that came with the X rebrand (although you might still find refrences to X and "posts" in some places.)
