NeoFreeBird is a modified version of a modern Twitter app with various changes such as branding reverts and removal of unnecessary features along with BetterBH for blocking ads, getting various Twitter Blue features for free and being able to customize Twitter in various ways like picking your own font or similar. 

NeoFreeBird differs from older Twitter app versions as it uses a more recent Twitter app in order to keep features working for potential API changes and similar along with keeping optimizations for newer devices.

> [!NOTE]  
> <b>There are some remaints</b><br>You may still see some X branding and references to posts/posting, especially in web based stuff like Community Notes. We try our best to get rid of most of them.

> [!TIP]
> <b>Would you rather add the patches yourself instead of using the IPA?</b> <br>
> You can follow [these instructions](/P-I-Y.md) in order to make your own NeoFreeBird.

NeoFreeBird is forked from FreeBird by nyathea as they've abandoned it.
