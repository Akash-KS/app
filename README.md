# FreeBird
FreeBird is an custom IPA of twitter that aims to remove as much X branding and text as possible as well as remove unnecessary changes.

This is done by patching files in the offical ipa with ones from pre-X versions of twitter. (you might still find refrences to X and "posts" in some places.)

BHTwitter is injected in the IPA as-well so you can block twitter ads and more.

# What's Next?
FreeBird v1.1 will be released in the coming days. It will come with much needed changes to hopefully make sideloading with altstore/sidestore work. and updating the base version with a newer version of X.
