# FreeBird

## Description:
FreeBird is an custom IPA of twitter that aims to remove as much X branding and text as possible as well as remove unnecessary features.

This is done by replacing files in the offical X ipa with ones from pre-X builds of twitter and manually adding things when needed. all of the text had to be changed to remove all traces of "X" and "Posts" (although you might find refrences to X and posts in some places. most of these cannot be changed.)
