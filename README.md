## Why NeoFreeBird?
NeoFreeBird differs from older Twitter apps or other branding reverts, as it constantly updates its Twitter app in order to keep features working for potential API changes and similar, along with keeping optimizations for newer devices


> [!NOTE]  
> <b>There are some remains</b><br>You may still see some X branding and references to posts/posting, especially in web based stuff like Community Notes. We try our best to get rid of most of them.

> [!TIP]
> <b>Would you rather add the patches yourself instead of using the IPA?</b> <br>
> You can follow [these instructions](/docs/P-I-Y.md) in order to make your own NeoFreeBird.
> Don't forget to run it through [NeoFreeBird-BHTwitter](https://github.com/actuallyaridan/NeoFreeBird-BHTwitter) to get all features!
