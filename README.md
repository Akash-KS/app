# NeoFreeBird
NeoFreeBird is a modified version of a modern Twitter (also known as X) app with various changes such as branding reverts and removal of unnecessary features along with BetterBH for blocking ads, getting various Twitter Blue features for free and being able to customize Twitter in various ways like picking your own font or similar. 

NeoFreeBird differs from older Twitter app versions as it uses a more recent Twitter app in order to keep features working for potential API changes and similar along with keeping optimizations for newer devices.

> [!NOTE]  
> You may still see some X branding and references to posts/posting, especially in web based stuff, like Community Notes.

NeoFreeBird is forked from FreeBird by nyathea as they've abandoned it.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> NeoFreeBird is currently under testing. A build will be released once testing is complete.
